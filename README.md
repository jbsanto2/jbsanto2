### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jalyne. I was born and raised in California until I moved to Maryland in 2020. I have been in and out of college since I graduated high school in 2017. I am happy to say that I will be obtaining my degree in Graphic Information Technology within the next year. Outside of school and work I enjoy working on my small business where I make candles and jewelry. 

This is my Linkedin!
